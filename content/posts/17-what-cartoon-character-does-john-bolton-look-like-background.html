    <h3>Please don&#039;t copy this quiz word from word, just don&#039;t do it.</h3>
    <p>So for the longest time this website had not one character match personality quiz, but i guess it was inevitable because here is an attempt at a slightly more scientific, but still silly, which character are you? test. Harry bolton didn&#039;t really like sport at all until he discovered something both new and unusual. Does this have any significance? 46 who does john spend time with at the weekend?</p>
