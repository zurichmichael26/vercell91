    <h3>Postage stamps were first introduced in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland on may 1, 1840 as part of postal reforms promoted by rowland hill.</h3>
    <p>Disney cartoon characters have been featured on foreign stamps, also. However, usa federal law forbids postage stamps depicting foreign heads of state, so the usa stamp listed her as grace kelly, while the monaco stamp listed her as princess grace. This may essentially be what you call a glimpse of postage if you are going to send a letter, you only have to fold the paper and seal it shut. But the walt disney company celebrates mickey mouse birth as november 18, 1928 upon the release of steamboat willie , because it is the first mickey mouse cartoon with sound.</p>
